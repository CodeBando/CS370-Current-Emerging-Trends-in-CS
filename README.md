This repository holds the final project from my Current and Emerging trend in Computer Science Course, and AI pathfinding system. Details regarding the application and project are below.

## Project Overview

### Project Description
The goal of this project was to design an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. The intelligent agent represents a pirate who's goal is to navigate a maze of pathways and obstacles to find a treasure before the player does. This is a project involved utilizing provided code and code developed by myself. 

### Provided Code:
The code provided to me included three files. Two Python files and a JuypterNotebook file. <br>
#### Python files
* TreasureMaze.py
<br>This is a Python class file that is utilized to represent the enviroment of the maze, defined as a matrix. It also handles the state of the maze as the agent navigates it, providing rewards for each movement. <br>

* GameExperience.py
<br> This is a Python class that is utized to store the episodes during training and to be utilized through training for exploration. As the model completes its training, it can pull from this class to
